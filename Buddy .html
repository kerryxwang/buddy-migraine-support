<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><i>Effective date: May 12, 2018</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Thank you for using Buddy! We take your privacy extremely seriously and would like to describe how we collect, use and protect your information when you access our website(s), products, services and applications (collectively, the “Services”).</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; line-height: 31.0px; font: 22.7px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“<b>Personal Information</b>”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information in order to make our Services available to you, to contact you, and to better understand how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at operationxray1@gmail.com.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by updating the date above and placing a notice on [insert web link here], by sending you an email, or by some other means. Your use of the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted will be considered to indicate your acceptance of the changes.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; line-height: 31.0px; font: 22.7px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>What Information does Buddy Collect?</b></span></h2>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. When you create a new account to use the Services we will solicit your consent to connect your Google account to your new Buddy account (using Google’s OAuth authentication method), thereby providing us with access to your email, Contacts, and Calendar. Although the OAuth authentication provides broad access to your Google account, Buddy only collects your name and email address to keep track of what levels you have completed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">In addition, we collect Personal Information you submit to us, for example by completing a form on [insert web link for user feedback online]. In that case, we may communicate with you, for example by sending you promotional email offers, or emailing you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps enhance our engagement with you and generally improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to operationxray1@gmail.com.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns, and generally to improve the Services.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 9.3px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 17.3px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</b></span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><b>Agents and vendors:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them, including in some cases the Personal Information you have provided to us, in order to make the Services available to you. For example, we may use third party hosting providers or software developers to help implement and maintain the Services. However, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><b>Business Transfers:</b> If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><b>Protection of Buddy and Others:</b> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our applicable terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Buddy, our employees, our users, or others.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; line-height: 31.0px; font: 22.7px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>Is Personal Information about me secure?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We will use very diligent efforts to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; line-height: 31.0px; font: 22.7px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>What Personal Information can I access?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Because the Personal Information you share with us via the Google OAuth authentication process originates in your Gmail account, if you want to modify that Personal Information you may do so through your Gmail account. Alternatively, you can email kxwang@gmail.com for access to, or to update or delete, your Personal Information that Buddy has collected.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.
